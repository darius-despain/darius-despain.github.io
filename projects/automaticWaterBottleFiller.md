My partner and I designed and constructed a device that would scan a RFID chip, program the value of the chip with the duration you fill the container of water, then when you fill it up again, you could scan it and press one button to dispense automatically. 

This was based on the Arduino Uno connected to a custom circuit to power the pump and a RFID reader to read the chips. While we used RFID chips separate from containers, this could be manufactured into sleeves or smaller patches to go onto water bottles more conveniently, allowing the user to just place the water bottle and not worry about scanning a chip. This technology could also be integrated into refrigerators or other water stations already on the market at a relatively low cost.
