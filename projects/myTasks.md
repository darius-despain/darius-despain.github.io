My team and I noticed that students always have lots of homework to do with varying due dates, complexities, and weights. Taking this into account we started development on an app that would help the user keep track of tasks, while taking into account the complexities with different tasks. The user is able to input field such as due date, approximate time to complete task, and a priority field to give more weight to that task over others of the same complexity. 

We utilized the Java programming language to make this app and SQLite to store the tasks that would be made by the user. The prioritization function written into the program calculated the priority of a task given data from the user input. It would then sort them to keep the user on track for what is more important.
