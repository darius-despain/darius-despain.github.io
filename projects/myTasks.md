summary: My team and I developed a task prioritizer app called MyTasks to give students a prioritized to do list.

Taking this into account we started development on an app that would help the user keep track of tasks, while taking into account the complexities with different tasks.  

We utilized the Java programming language to make this app and SQLite to store the tasks that would be made by the user. The prioritization function written into the program calculated the priority of a task given data from the user input. It would then sort them to keep the user on track for what is more important. 

## Problem: 
My team and I noticed that students always have lots of homework to do with varying due dates, complexities, and weights. We noticed figuring out what to work on first was always a challenge, so we thought to design an app to help keep the user more organized. 

## Behavior:
The user is able to input field such as due date, approximate time to complete task, and an importance field to give more weight to that task over others of the same complexity. The app then sorts the list of tasks 

## My role:
helped come up with the priority algorithm and all the fields for user input. Came up with initial ideas to get the project going. Debugged problems in code

Expandability 


## Expandability: 
* Add tab with extra tools 
* Input classes and syllabus weights. Could use to factor into priority function 
* Grade calculator for specific classes 
* Share tasks between users 
* For collaborative projects 
* Add progress updates for better tracking performance 
* Use to sort better 

## Skills: 
* Programming Languages: Java, SQLite 
* Github used to sync android studio with 3 people
