summary: A C++ based game to mimic the Japanese handheld pet game Tamagotchi.
---

Using C++, our team wrote a game based on the Japanese handheld pet game Tamagotchi. This game creates a virtual pet upon startup and has different stats, then according to different user inputs the pet will continue to grow or die. The user can perform many different functions including sleep, feed, clean, and play where each function will affect the stats of the pet based on the outcome of the function.

This project was one of our first times using an object oriented language and our first time utilizing objects to store data. From this project we learned that objects are a concise way of storing similar, related information that can be accessed easily and makes coding and understanding a program much easier.
