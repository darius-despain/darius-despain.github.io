<!-- UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?
          
          For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.
          
          Feel free to go in another direction entirely, as long as you are discussing UI Frameworks, and as long as the result is interesting, informative, and insightful. Write for the world!

##Introduction
Sometimes code can get complicated enough to where it is not efficient to write all your own material. This can be seen in many development environments such as prewritten functions and classes for object oriented languages or UI frameworks in web development, enabling users to save time with complicated layouts rather than writing with raw HTML and CSS. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using UI frameworks in web development.

##Standard HTML and CSS
HTML is the language web development is based around to organize content and enable links or other functions. It is somewhat tedious of a language as each element must be called directly. An example of HTML and what it displays can be seen below. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

##Benefits of UI Frameworks
This is similar to using other development environments in other languages that might have prewritten pieces of code to use, an example of this is
