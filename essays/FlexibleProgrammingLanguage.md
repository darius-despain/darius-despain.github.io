When I started this course, I had no idea how to code anything in Javascript. I had never seen an application of it and really not stepped out of my safe space in engineering of C and C++, but I welcomed the change. As it turns out C++ and Javascript aren't all that different, but Javascript has numerous features in its syntax that make it far more flexible and powerful than C++ in some ways. 

## How Does Javascript Compare?
My background is primary in the languages of C and C++, so transitioning to Javascript was fairly easy, the statements are all very similar with only a few differences. These differences include mainly how data is stored and manipulated and the tolerance of the language. 

The primary difference when programming in Javascript is that you do not need to assign variable types and they can change within the same variable based on the user's needs. This, while unconventional, saves time when programming and adds extra options of being able to return strings or numbers based on the needs of a function or when passing information. An example of this is passing errors in functions. In Javascript, the solution is to return a string with the error statement, however, in C or C++ you would have to make additional variables for indicators or to directly pass error messages, but this could not be the same variable as the return data. This allows javascript to be faster to write and simpler to read. 

The other main difference is the tolerance of the language. When in C or C++, a program will not compile without every semicolon exactly where it needs to be, but in Javascript this is not the case. In Javascript the program will still run if the program is missing a couple semicolons. This makes error check much less tedious and allows more rapid development of code without copious amounts of time to review the code with errors.

## Javascript for Software Engineering  
Javascript, as mentioned in the previous section, is very good for rapid development. This is perfect for timed exercises such as the WODs we do in ICS 314 as we are able to focus more on the logic of the code, rather than fixing small syntax errors or trying to find some messy way to pass data in and out of a function. This means that Javascript is very good for development of applications that don't require the fastest performance or low-level control. For the educational setting or a beginning development setting, this is the perfect language to use where focus on the problems are more important than worrying about optimizing the performance on the hardware.

## Athletic Software Engineering 
Javascript enables us to rapidly develop code for all sorts of problems, especially the WODs and other assignments in ICS 314. I find these to be very effective as they allow the student to problem solve and the tools provided in class are sufficient to allow us to solve the problem. The assignments allow us to practice our knowledge and find out what works and doesn't work in real examples. I find this method of exercises to be fun and competitive while allowing for the learning process.
