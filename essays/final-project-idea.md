## The Problem
Students on campus often need spaces to study and each student has a unique set of requirements for their study space. Given that students at UH Manoa are of various majors and are located on different parts of campus or have different needs to finish their work, this may prove difficult for students to always find an adequate space for their study needs.

## The Solution
The solution to this problem includes a web application for students to determine what study spaces on campus are appropriate for them and which ones are closest to them.

# Mockup page ideas
This solution would have the following pages:
- Homepage
- List of Study Spaces
- Login
- Register
- Student profile

# Use case ideas
Students are able to use this to see available lounge locations on campus in one consolidated place. This will list hours, capabilities, capacity of the location, and accessibility to different types of students.  It could take the student's record including class schedule and major to filter locations based on if the student has access or what kind of resources they require based on the classes they take. It could also sort the locations based on the proximity to the students' location allowing them to have a list of most optimal locations.

# Beyond the basics
Expanding on this, a lounge location could update the current capacity in real time allowing students to determine if the lounge they wish to go to has enough space for them or not.
