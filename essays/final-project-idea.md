## 1	Introduction

Cloud Computing is a term used to describe something that goes on in most commercial activity today. Cloud Computing can be thought of as similar to the movement of outsourcing manufacturing for consumer products, where a company designs a product, but does not have the facilities necessary to manufacture the product, so they hire a company to make it for them where their sole focus is to manufacture, not design, the product. In this movement, companies could cut overhead costs by not requiring huge facilities to fabricate their designs and instead just pay someone else to do it for them. This had a huge impact on the consumer product market because new companies could be formed with very little capital and still be able to fabricate competitive products. Cloud Computing takes this idea and applies it to the world of computers, where software have become services. 

This report summarizes a more detailed research paper [1] and is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses what cloud computing is, section 3 discusses why this is happening now, section 4 discusses different classes of utility computing, section 5 discusses the economics of cloud computing, section 6 discusses obstacles and opportunities for cloud computing, and section 7 is the conclusion.

## 2	What is Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is both the software running as services on the internet as well as the hardware and infrastructure that make up the datacenters powering these services. Software used as a service is known as Software as a Service (SaaS), and this is what Cloud Computing is powering. The hardware and infrastructure that make up datacenters, as well as the software that allocates it all, is known as a Cloud. 
	
Clouds are broken up into two types, public and private clouds. When a Cloud is offered as a paid service open to the public, it’s called a Public Cloud. Public Clouds offer what’s known as Utility Computing, which is the processing that makes up SaaS. When a Cloud is made up of internal datacenters for a specific company and not offered to the public, then it is called a Private Cloud. Cloud Computing refers to the sum of all Utility Computing and SaaS, but does not normally include Private Clouds as they are not available to the public. 

Cloud Computing has many advantages to companies including not having to worry about maintaining a datacenter, less capital required to expand when demand rises, and centralized control. It also holds advantages for consumers as well including accessing data from anywhere at any time, data security, and easier collaboration. As discussed with the outsourcing of manufacturing, now companies outsource processing power so that when they need to launch or expand some SaaS it requires much less capital and is scalable. Similar to how users outsource their problems to the SaaS, SaaS providers outsource their problems onto Cloud providers. 
	
## 3	Why Now?

The boom in Cloud Computing of recent years wasn’t necessarily only due to the ability to manufacture large datacenters but is also due to the culture change and technological advancements of recent years that’s allowed the demand for Cloud Computing to skyrocket.
3.1	New Technology Trends and Business Models	
	
In the beginning, what we call Web 1.0, in order to accept a credit card payment from a stranger one had to have a contract with a company such as VeriSign or Authorize.net, making it very difficult for small businesses or individuals to acquire this same access. With the emergence of services such as PayPal, contracts were not needed and businesses could then accept credit card payments from consumers. This change is what we call Web 2.0 and it opened the gates for many small businesses to innovate and start making websites that charge for services. Other services also have emerged with Web 2.0 such as Google AdSense to generate revenue for traffic on websites rather than going through a separate advertisement company such as DoubleClick. 

There was also a shift in technology for Cloud Providers where companies, such as Amazon Web Services, offered pay-as-you-go computing only requiring a credit card payment. Other innovations include implementing virtual machines that allowed multiple customers to share the same hardware without disrupting each other.
3.2	New Application Opportunities

In order for Cloud Computing to flourish, there had to be more practical application for consumers and up until recently, most of the world didn’t use computers in their daily lives or would even have a use for them if they had them. The factors that impact the variety of applications and therefore the demand for Cloud Computing are Mobile interactive applications, Parallel batch processing, the rise of analytics, extension of compute-intensive desktop applications, and “Earthbound” applications. 

Demand for Cloud Computing took off when mobile computing became more widely used, i.e. smartphones. The introduction of real-time data being fed increased the possibilities of Cloud Computing and while not all smartphones are connected to the internet all the time, they will still be feeding more data over time than a device such as a desktop PC which is only being used for a very small portion of a person’s day. The other applications come from being able to run applications across multiple machines with parallel batch processing, increased demand for analysis of data in businesses with more data being collected from all these new devices on the market, and applications such as Matlab that can utilize Cloud Computing to perform their extensive and normally lengthy calculations. 

“Earthbound” applications refers to applications that require much more bandwidth or processing power than can be transmitted across the internet, such as stock trading which requires microsecond precision. Once data transmission technology is improved, this area will open up more applications for Cloud Computing.

## 4	Classes of Utility Computing

There are different methods for Cloud Computing which will change the cost and optimization of certain users needs. These are broken up into models, they are the computation model, storage model, and networking model.

One example is of the Amazon EC2, which behaves very much like physical hardware and allows the user to manipulate it as such. This type is excellent for programmers who would want to work on their own physical machine or have complete control to do whatever they want; however, it would not be ideal for somebody who needs automatic scalability. On the other end of the spectrum, application domain-specific platforms such as Google AppEngine utilize a request-reply based service where they only are allocated the hardware they need, which is excellent for scalability, but isn’t suitable for general-purpose computing.

Other systems are varied in functionality between these examples and serve different purposes for each customer based on their need. 

## 5	Cloud Computing Economics

5.1	Elasticity: Shifting the Risk

Prior to Cloud Computing, building datacenters was the only way to achieve massive amount of computing power for a company, this came with the upfront expense and therefore was not done by many. By utilizing Cloud Computing, companies don’t have to pay this upfront cost, so starting a company based on SaaS isn’t ask risk heavy, thus increasing the volume of companies. 

5.2	Comparing Costs: Should I Move to the Cloud?

For some higher volume users, they debate whether moving to a Cloud or staying with their own datacenter is worth the cost. Since it is more worth it for a company to use Cloud Computing with low-volume applications to avoid the startup cost, larger companies face this dilemma. Companies decide based on factors such as pay separation of resources, power, cooling, and physical costs of a plant, and operation costs. These all go into whether it is worth the company’s resources to outsource to Cloud Computing or to maintain/create a datacenter.

## 6	Top 10 Obstacles and Opportunities for Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing has its flaws, just like any other outsourcing and reallocation of resources. Obstacles that companies are faced with when considering Cloud Computing is the availability of the service, data lock-in, data confidentiality and auditability, data transfer bottlenecks, performance unpredictability, scalable storage, bugs in large-scale distributed systems, scaling quickly, reputation fate sharing, and software licensing. 

Availability is huge, there has to be enough Cloud providers to provide for the SaaS providers, when there is an imbalance then money or opportunities are lost. Data lock-in could be a problem when the company and consumer aren’t on the best terms, due to price increases etc., and they can hold data ransom if needed. Data confidentially is also a problem here as companies don’t have direct control over there data and someone else also has access to them. Bottlenecks can happen as well because all the information flows through the data lines going out of the datacenter they are using, so if there are network problems or heavy traffic, then speeds are slowed down. It can also be more unpredictable due to the variable traffic and reallocation of hardware resources, so some times of the day might allow for ample hardware allocation, but others may not. Storage also could not be scalable as with increasing size of a company, the datacenter may not necessarily increase in size, so eventually a ceiling will be reached.

## 7	Conclusions

In summary Cloud Computing is an industry changing concept that utilizes and drive the economy of the internet so that we can have the booming internet content that is being created all the time. It has benefits on the users’ end with more variety of companies since more companies are able to take advantage of modern technology, and on the companies many smaller ones can startup faster with the scalability and low cost of Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing is a concept which is shaping our industry and will continue to shape the way the world behaves as more and more technology is developed to connect us all together.
